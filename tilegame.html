            <h1>Simple Tile Based Game</h1>
            <p>This project is a simple tile based game built in Java and rendered using
                the Princeton Standard Draw library. The game consists of a 
                randomly generated world of rooms and hallways that the 
                player must navigate to find a key that allows them 
                to escape the world and win. The player can use their mouse
                to see tile descriptions, WASD to navigate, X to change view,
                and ":q" during the game to save and quit.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> The game uses a graph to represent the location of the rooms
                and a minimum spanning tree algorithm to determine the 
                generation of the hallways. The game also features a full save
                and quit functionality and full random generation via seed input.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Game Download</h2>
            <p>The game can be download via this <a href="Tile Game/proj3.jar">Link</a>
            which will download a .jar file. Create a folder on your desktop
            (or wherever) and place the .jar file within the folder. If the game does not 
            launch when double clicked or launched normally, use the following steps. You also
            may need to override your computers security settings, on mac this is done 
            in the "security and privacy" section in settings that can be found via
            the search bar.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Open to your terminal and navigate to the folder where your game is downloaded.
                If this is on your desktop you might then run "cd desktop/yourfoldername".
                Once you're in the directory containing your game, use "java -jar proj3.jar"
                and the game should succesfully launch.

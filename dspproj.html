        <h1>Disabled Students Program - Database Management System</h1>

        <p>
          While working for the Disabled Students Program at UC Berkeley, it
          became apparent that our current system for managing our inventory was
          inefficient and overly complicated. In its current state our general
          workflow was: Boss reviews requests and sends them to furniture team
          -> furniture team moves items to desired locations (i.e. moving an
          unused wheelchair accesible desk in Dwinelle 242 to Wheeler 100) ->
          furniture team confirms the move and sends picture of moved item to
          boss -> boss (usually) updates spreadsheet with new location and
          uploads image to google drive folder with images of every item. Now
          when a new request would come up we would generally try to find an
          item that matched the request that was as close as possible, and if
          not take a new one from the depot. In order to perform this search one
          would have to look through the "inventory" spreadshet, find an item
          that matches and see if it is currently in use via requests
          spreadsheet, confirm the items location by referencing the most recent
          image instance of that item in the image folder, and then hopefully go
          get that item.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          Realizing the inneficiencies of this method, I set about constructing
          a relational database that would serve as a more organized and
          constrained base for a web based dashboard to keep track of items and
          ease the search process. Following my implementation of this system,
          the workflow is now much more efficient, allows for a much better
          search functionality, and individuals on the furniture team can work
          more independently.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          The general workflow is now much simpler; Boss sends request at the
          beginning of the week -> furniture team can independently locate
          correct unsued items in/near the requested location -> furniture team
          updates/adds items and photos as needed. Features like item use and
          "last updated" status, building location, easy image uploads and
          timestamping, and a fast search have greatly improved the overall
          capabilities of our team and will continue to have lasting effects as
          a more permanent system that doesn't need regular updates/clearing
          each semester. Additionally new members of the team have a much easier
          time becoming familiar with the system compared to the somewhat
          convuluted mess of spreadsheets and google drive folders from before.
          Missing/unused inventory items are also routinely identified and the
          issue rectified leading to lower costs and wasted time for the team as
          a whole, while enabling us to better serve students with
          accomodations.

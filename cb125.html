            <h1>1978 Honda CB125s</h1>
            <p> This bike was my first real motorcycle, and also my first motorcycle
                that I really worked on myself. Prior to this I had rode my dads old 
                Honda Elite 150 but that was about it. This Honda wasn't in the best shape
                when I got it, but it did (mostly) run.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I started with the basics; cleaned and adjusted carb, new tires,
                adjusted clutch and brakes, new fuel line and filter, transmission
                and engine oil change, and other small fixes. Then I started to move on
                to replacing old parts and adding new parts to go for a more cafe style
                look and build. I replaced the seat with a new lower profile seat, got
                new lower profile handlebars, replaced the old rear shocks and springs,
                got new mirrors, and added a new led taillight and license plate mount.

            <p>
                My next step was definitely the hardest part as I had very little experience
                with: wiring. I wanted to swap to a new led headlight as the old headlight
                was super dim on the 6v battery and the old turn signals didn't work. Due to the 
                bikes use of an old 6v battery and wiring system, I decided to add a small 
                external battery mounted under the seat that would power the new headlight and turn signals 
                as well as the rear tailight. This became a bigger piece of work than I had 
                imagined when I realized someone before me had redone a lot of wiring and 
                did not keep the original color codes, so hours were spent figuring out what was 
                connected to what. After many grueling hours I finally got everything done and to 
                finish it all up I wired the new battery kill switch to an old ceiling fan/lamp pull cord
                which had one of those little wooden knob and brass chains to turn everything on.

                With most cosmetics and maintenance complete, as well as street legal and fully functioning lights,
                I was ready to get the bike fully registered so I could begin riding it (legally). I had also 
                planned to next do a top end engine rebuild, and hopefully get the bike running at full power again. 
                Unfortunately, I brought the bike up with me to Berkeley to ride it around town, and after 1 week 
                of being there the garage I parked in suffered a gate malfunction and the bike was gone. 
                With no insurance yet and a bike not even in the DMV system (45 year old bike) I was 
                pretty much out of luck, and that was the end of the story for my Honda.
